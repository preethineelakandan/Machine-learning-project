Introduction

Welcome to the exciting world of orthopedic classification using machine learning! In this project, we're diving into a fascinating journey of using computer algorithms and categorize orthopedic conditions more efficiently.Orthopedic conditions involve problems with bones, joints, and muscles. Identifying and classifying these issues accurately is crucial for giving patients the right treatment. Traditional methods can be slow and might vary between different doctors. Machine learning can make this process faster and more reliable.
